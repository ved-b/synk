# The Problem
As avid music enthusiasts we donâ€™t only love listening to music, we love sharing our new finds with our friends. However, due to the difference in the platforms, sharing new songs and creating shared playlists with our friends is a cumbersome process. We firmly believe that music is the root of unity and the division caused by the streaming platforms ecosystems have contrasted the most powerful aspect of music.
